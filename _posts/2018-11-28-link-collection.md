An occasional collection of conferences, workhops and other things going on in
Hungary and relevant for bionformatics, genomics and systems biology. Drop us an
email if you know about something interesting. Part 2, where we are stretching
the limits of what is considered computational biology.

* Call for the "[Junior Biostatistician of
  2018](http://www.biostat.hu/2018/11/08/a-2018-ev-fiatal-biostatisztikusa-palyazat-kiirasa/)"
  from the [Association of Clinical Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.hu/) (in hungarian). Deadline is
  18th of January, 2019.
* Invitation for the [Hungarian Molecular Life Science
  2019](http://2019.hunlifesci.hu/invitation/) conference. Topics ranging from
  biochemistry to genomics. Abstract deadline is 31st of January, 2019.
* Website of the [Visegr√°d Group Society for Developmental
  Biology](http://www.v4sdb.org/index). Kind of stretching the limits here, but
  [all biology is computational
  biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050),
  right?
* [MBK Napok](https://www.naik.hu/esemenyek/mbk-napok-2018), with some talks on
  RNA biology, genomics and bioinformatics (in hungarian).
* Was wondering about where to do an internship in genomics, bioinformatics,
  cheminformatics, digital pathology or similar, outside academic research in
  Hungary. There are a number of companies, including
  [Omixon](https://www.omixon.com/), [turbine.ai](https://turbine.ai/),
  [Mcule](https://mcule.com/), [3DHistech](https://www.3dhistech.com/). Know any
  others?

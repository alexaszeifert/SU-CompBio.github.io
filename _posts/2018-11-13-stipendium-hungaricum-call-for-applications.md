## Role of chromatin structure and expression variance in cancer mutation patterns and signatures

*Call for expression of interest to submit a Stipendium Hungaricum Fellowship
with the Computational Biology Group of Semmelweis University, located at the
1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research*

We are looking for interested candidates to submit a Stipendium Hungaricum PhD
Fellowship and in case of a successful application, join our new computational
biology group at [Semmelweis University](http://semmelweis.hu/). Semmelweis
University is the oldest medical university in Hungary, integrating education,
research and healing. The [1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer
Research](http://semmelweis.hu/patologia1/en/), where the group is located,
possesses over 150 years of experience in diagnostic pathology, medical training
and various fields of experimental cancer research. The fellowship provides
exemption from the PhD tuition fee, gives a monthly stipend, contributes to
accommodation costs and medical insurance.

The PhD research will focus on understanding mutation rate and mutation
signature variation across the cancer genome, influenced by DNA damage repair
enzyme expression variation, besides various genomic features like 3D genome
structure, histone marks, lamina-associated domains, DNA shape and DNA-protein
interactions. Candidates should be interested in cancer, bioinformatics,
genomics, mutation signatures, chromatin structure, molecular noise and
evolution.

*What we offer in case of a successful fellowship*

* An interdisciplinary research environment, ranging from basic cancer research
  to molecular diagnostics and digital pathology
* Mentoring according to long-term career goals
* Opportunity to learn cutting edge bioinformatics and genomics

*Required skills*

* Excellent communication skills in English
* Familiarity with Linux, command line tools and scripting
* Solid understanding of molecular biology, genome structure and cancer
* Proficiency in at least one programming language (R, Python, Perl)

*Additional preferred skills*

* Familiarity with high-throughput sequencing technologies
* International research experience
* Previous research output in the form of published papers, software, datasets
  or similar

## Application procedure

If you are interested, please check that you fulfil the call’s eligibility
criteria and send an expression of interest, consisting of a CV, list of
publications, 2 reference letters, a one paragraph summary of your most
significant scientific contribution, and another paragraph on what your main
interests and goals are in a single PDF to the following email address:
[sebestyen.endre@med.semmelweis-univ.hu](mailto:sebestyen.endre@med.semmelweis-univ.hu)
with “Stipendium Hungaricum Fellowship – Mutation variation” in the subject, by
no later than 16th of December, 2018.

The expected deadline for the fellowship application is 15th of January, 2019.
Selected candidate(s) will be fully supported during the application procedure.

The group officially joined the [European Epitranscriptomics
Network](https://epitran.eu/), funded by
[COST](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA16120/), as the second hungarian MC Member.
The network aims to strengthen the emerging research field of epitranscriptomics
in Europe, by facilitating information exchange, collaborations, and integrating
biotech companies. Epitranscriptomics as a field tries to understand the
physiological and pathological roles of RNA modifications, that might influence
various aspects of RNA biology. These include RNA stability, structure,
splicing, decay, translation, export, localization, or RNA-protein interactions.
